_Havoc-OS, please support my new device!_

It's up to you.

Sorry to let you down, but Havoc-OS device support has nothing to do with the number of device requests received. The folks who maintain devices for Havoc-OS choose devices that interest them. Remember, these are regular people enjoying a hobby. Havoc-OS is not a corporation with employees.

If you know someone who has knowledge in building ROMs, you can send [this url]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/adding-device/) to that person.
